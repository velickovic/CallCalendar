Display a responsive and customized warning banner and disable cookies when users enter your website until you obtain their consent.]]></description_full><additional_description><![CDATA[Our module fully complies with the European Cookie Law.    Complete compliance with the law    Besides displaying a warning banner, our module is the only one that allows you to block the cookies when users enter your store. As established by the law, you &quot;shall ensure that the storing of information, or the gaining of access to information already stored, in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user is only allowed on condition that the subscriber or user concerned has given his or her consent, having been provided with clear and comprehensive information.&quot;    Please note that all the other cookie modules sold on Addons only allows you to display a warning banner regardless of the user consent. Cookies are installed on the users&#39; computer without obtaining their consent and regardless of their will.    Main features of the modules     Display a warning banner on every page to inform users about the use of cookies and ask for their consent   Disable a list of modules when users enter the website because warning users about cookies is useless and illegal if you have already installed cookies on their computer.   Enable these cookies after having obtained their consent or maintain them disabled if they refuse.   Fully customize the warning banner (colour, text, link, font, position, multilingual mode, transparency...)      Getting the user consent  &nbsp;  The module includes 3 different ways to ask user consent, you can choose between:     Acceptance through a button: Users must click on the &quot;I accept&quot; button in the warning banner to give his consent. As soon as users give their consent, the warning banner disappears and all the modules using cookies will get enabled and will work as usual. But if users refuse to give their consent, the disabled modules will remain disabled.   Acceptance through the navigation (with banner&nbsp;disappearance): If users continue browsing the website, they will accept the use of cookies. The warning banner is displayed on the first page on which users arrive with a message like &laquo;&nbsp;By continuing browsing the website, you accept the use of cookies&nbsp;&raquo;. As soon as users decide to go to another page, the banner automatically disappears and the disabled modules will get enabled.   Acceptance through the navigation (without banner&nbsp;disappearance) : If users continue browsing the website, they will accept the use of cookies. Works the same as the previous option except the fact that the banner is always displayed and never disappears. The selected cookies will be disabled when users enter the store and will get enabled only when users will decide to go another page.    Note: the consent remains valid during the period of time set in the module interface (we recommend you not to go over 13 months)    Customizing the banner content and design    As recommended by the European authority, the module allows you to customize the warning message inside the banner (to inform users about the cookies users and their purpose) and add a &quot;More information&quot; button into the banner that take users to a CMS page of your store (to explain in details the use of cookies on your store).    The warning banner is responsive and will always be displayed full-width. The module comes with a Wysiwyg editor that allows you to fully customize the content of the banner (font, colour, effects, html code, links...). You can also choose from the configuration page the background colour of the banner, its percentage of opacity (transparency) and its position (top or bottom of the page). Moreover, the module is mutlilingual and automatially detects all the languages of your store, which allows you to set a different warning message per language.    Note: the module is designed to not display a warning message when search engines robots cawl you store in order not to affect your SEO.    Disabling the modules that use cookies    This is the only module that allows you to choose the modules/cookies that you want to disable until users give their consent. This feature is compulsory because it is useless and illegal to inform users if you have already installed cookied on their computer with their consent.    &quot;Member States shall ensure that the storing of information, or the gaining of access to information already stored, in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user is only allowed on condition that the subscriber or user concerned has given his or her consent, having been provided with clear and comprehensive information, in accordance with Directive 95/46/EC&rdquo; EU Cookie Law    To comply with the directive of the EU Cookie Law, we recommend you to disable the tracking (Google Analytics), social sharing (Facebook &quot; Like &quot;, Google &quot; +1 &quot;, etc.) and targeted advertising modules. Please note that all modules that are required for the good running of your PrestaShop store (ex: basket cookie, session cookie...) don&#39;t require any consents.    Multistore mode    The module is compatible with multistore and allows you to display the same notification banner on each one of your shop but the consent is the same for all shops. If you accept the use of cookies on one of your shop, the module will consider that you accept the use of cookies for all your other shops (mention it on your cookie policy) and the notification banner will not be shown when you go to your other shops.]]></additional_description><author><![CDATA[Línea Gráfica]]></author><tab><![CDATA[administration]]></tab><version><![CDATA[1.1]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.5.0.0]]></from><to><![CDATA[1.5.6.3]]></to></compatibility><nb_rates><![CDATA[83]]></nb_rates><avg_rate><![CDATA[4.1]]></avg_rate><img><![CDATA[http://addons-media.prestashop.com/img/pico/8734.jpg]]></img><price><EUR><![CDATA[29.99]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[44.99]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[24.99]]></GBP></price><url><![CDATA[http://addons.prestashop.com//en/administration-tools-prestashop-modules/8734-eu-cookie-law-notification-banner-cookie-blocker.html?utm_source=back-office&utm_medium=push-addons&utm_campaign=back-office-EN&utm_content=download]]></url><badges><badge><![CDATA[http://medias3.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/certif_prestashop_en.png]]></badge></badges></module><module><id><![CDATA[11345]]></id><name><![CDATA[pushoncart]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[Push on Cart]]></displayName><description><![CDATA[Easily increase your average cart value by offering customized discounts to your client in the shopping cart summary !]]></description><description_full><![CDATA[Easily increase your average cart value by offering customized discounts to your client in the shopping cart summary !]]></description_full><additional_description><![CDATA[With the Push on Cart module:     Easily increase your customer&rsquo;s average cart value   Clear unsold products from your inventory   Help customers discover new products   Create demand for new products   Capitalize on impulse purchases   Improve customer satisfaction and loyalty with customized discounts on select products    ]]></additional_description><author><![CDATA[PrestaShop]]></author><tab><![CDATA[pricing_promotion]]></tab><version><![CDATA[1.0.2]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.5.0.0]]></from><to><![CDATA[1.6.0.9]]></to></compatibility><nb_rates><![CDATA[21]]></nb_rates><avg_rate><![CDATA[3.9]]></avg_rate><img><![CDATA[http://addons-media.prestashop.com/img/pico/11345.jpg]]></img><price><EUR><![CDATA[79.99]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[109.99]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[64.99]]></GBP></price><url><![CDATA[http://addons.prestashop.com//en/pricing-promotion-prestashop-modules/11345-push-on-cart.html?utm_source=back-office&utm_medium=push-addons&utm_campaign=back-office-EN&utm_content=download]]></url><badges><badge><![CDATA[http://medias3.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/certif_prestashop_en.png]]></badge></badges></module><module><id><![CDATA[16535]]></id><name><![CDATA[cartabandonmentpro]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[Abandoned Cart Reminder Pro]]></displayName><description><![CDATA[Improve your conversion rate by 15% (and more) with abandoned carts reminder emails!]]></description><description_full><![CDATA[Improve your conversion rate by 15% (and more) with abandoned carts reminder emails!]]></description_full><additional_description><![CDATA[An automatic email is sent to customers each time they add products to their shopping cart but does not purchase.
